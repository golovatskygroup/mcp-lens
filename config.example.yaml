# Example configuration for mcp-github-proxy
#
# This proxy starts an upstream MCP server as a child process.
# Currently the intended upstream is the official GitHub MCP server.

upstream:
  command: "npx"
  args:
    - "-y"
    - "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"
  env:
    # The upstream server expects this env var name.
    # We map it from your local environment variable GITHUB_TOKEN.
    GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
